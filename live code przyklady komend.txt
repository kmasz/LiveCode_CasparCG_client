Add a mouseUp handler to the card script, within it we use the target function to check which button was pressed.
on mouseUp
    local tColor
    ## Use the target function to check which button was pressed
    ## The short name of the buttons are red, blue and green 
    ## so we can use that to set the color 
    put the short name of the target into tColor
    set the textColor of field "text" to tColor
end mouseUp

Open the Code Editor for the card and add the following custom command
command colorText pColor
    set the textColor of field "text" to pColor
end colorText
This command takes a parameter, pColor, and sets the text color of the field to the value of that parameter.
Now open the script of button 'Red', change the mouseUp handler so it calls the custom command, passing the color as a parameter.
on mouseUp
    colorText "red"
end mouseUp
Repeat this for the other buttons, changing the parameter in each case.
An alternative option is to handle mouseUp on the card and call the custom command from the card script.
on mouseUp
    put the short name of the target into tColor
    colorText tColor
end mouseUp
